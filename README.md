# Currently

`currently` is a tool to display cards currently assigned to you on Trello.

## How to use it?

``` sh
mix deps.get
mix escriptize
./currently configure -k <key> -t <token>
./currently cards
```

You can create a Developer API key on https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate.
For the token, see
https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/index.html#getting-a-token-from-a-user.
